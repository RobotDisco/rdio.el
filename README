rdio.el allows Emacs to control the OS X Rdio application.

It does this using OSX Rdio's built-in Applescript interface.

Unfortunately this is OSX-specific right now, I'd love to find a way to work
a platform-agnostic solution (but Rdio's player framework requires some thought
in order to potentially achieve this.)

(rdio.el is currently small enough that it's a better documentation that the
software writer could ever be. For people new to Emacs, any function that
contains an (interactive) statement can be run via M-x. You can use standard
Emacs config to set up whatever hotkeys you like!)
